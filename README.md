Long-Context RAG AI

An AI system built for hackathons and beyond — combining **massive context retrieval**, **true data visualization**, **local-first privacy**, and **autonomous workflow orchestration**. Designed to turn raw datasets into actionable insights in real time.

Key Features

- **Long-Context RAG Architecture**  
  Harnesses Gemini’s huge context window to ingest entire private datasets (CSV, JSON, PDF) directly into the reasoning loop. Responses are grounded in *your* data, not generic knowledge.

- **True Data Visualization**  
  A heuristic parsing engine reads raw uploaded files to generate **dynamic, interactive charts** and statistical summaries (averages, peaks, trends) inside the chat and knowledge base.

- **Local-First Privacy**  
  All private documents and conversation histories are stored securely in your browser sandbox using **IndexedDB**. Your data stays local, minimizing external exposure.

- **Autonomous Workflow Orchestration**  
  The built-in **Neural Hub** detects intent and can schedule tasks, triggers, or automated reports based on extracted findings — going beyond simple Q&A.

- **Persona-Driven Intelligence**  
  Customize the AI’s analytical tone, depth, and output format with an **Identity Profile**, tailoring insights to your professional role.

Our system transforms raw datasets into real-time insights with long-context RAG, interactive visualization, and local-first privacy. It doesn’t just answer questions — it orchestrates workflows and adapts to your professional persona, making data analysis smarter, faster, and safer.
